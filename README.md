# LinkedListWithRandomPointer
A data structure problem which is about duplicating a linkedlist which has random pointers without using extra memory as described in this video : https://youtu.be/xbpUHSKoALg?t=27

**Statment** : Given a doubly LinkedList which has next pointer and a random pointer which can point to any node, create a duplicate list with exact pointers in constant space complexity.
